NLP approach to identify Area of Law for Law Judgments

Input: 100 Law Judgments 
Output: Area of Law of those judgments

There are 999 judgments in the Judgments folder. The Interview_Mapping.csv file provides the corresponding Area of Law of 899 judgments. The remaining 100, which are indicated by ‘To be Tested’ in the Area of Law column, will be used for testing. 

Task: 
•	Use the ~900 labeled judgments to build models to decide the area of law. 
•	Apply algorithms to the 100 unlabeled testing judgments
